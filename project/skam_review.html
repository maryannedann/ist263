        <div class="review_title">Skam: A Fantastic Foreign TV Show</div>

        <div class="review_text">
            Skam is a great, Norwegian, coming of age TV show. Here me out, if you dont like foreign shows just give this one a try, and please dont watch it dubbed in english. You must watch it in its language with english subtitles, in my personal opinion. "Skam" isn't just a TV show; it's a cultural phenomenon that has took the world by storm. This Norwegian teen drama, created by Julie Andem, offers a refreshingly authentic portrayal of the lives of high school students in Oslo. From the first episode, it's clear that "Skam" is not your typical teen drama. Instead of glamorizing the lives of its characters, the show delves into the messy, complicated realities of adolescence with honesty and nuance.

            What sets "Skam" apart is its innovative storytelling format. Each season focuses on a different main character, allowing viewers to see the world through their eyes and experience their struggles, triumphs, and relationships firsthand. The show also incorporates real-time storytelling, with clips and social media posts released throughout the week that correspond to the events of each episode. This immersive approach makes viewers feel like they're part of the characters' lives, creating a unique sense of intimacy and connection.
            
            But perhaps the most remarkable thing about "Skam" is its commitment to diversity and representation. The show tackles a wide range of issues, from mental health to sexuality to religious identity, with sensitivity and empathy. It's rare to see a TV show that portrays such a diverse array of characters and experiences, and "Skam" does so perfectly.
            
            When I get really invested in a show, I love to look up how it came to fruition and know more about the actors and directors. It surprised me that, for the most part, the actors were unknowns before the show. The creator, Julie Andem, wanted real kids to portray thse charecters so it felt more authentic and I found that effective. It also surprised me to find out there are many more skams in many different countries, so I may have plenty more to watch, but I dont think they will compare to the original.
            
            In the end, "Skam" is more than just a TV show; it's a cultural touchstone that has sparked important conversations and inspired audiences around the world. Whether you're a teenager grappling with the challenges of adolescence or an adult looking back on your own high school years, there's something in "Skam" that will resonate with you. So do yourself a favor and dive into this captivating seriesâ€”you won't regret it.
