        <div class="review_text">
            If you are ever feeling like your life is spiraling, out of control, and has no direction, watch “Love Has Won, The Cult of Mother God” and trust me you will feel very accomplished, put together, and more than anything normal. 
            This docuseries found on Max is the story of Amy Carlson, an ordinary woman who grew up in Kansas/Oklahoma City, had 3 children, and was a manager at McDonalds. That was until she became a cult leader under the belief that she was "Mother God" and died at the hands of her followers. Not only that but her body was carried around for days until the police got involved and found her mummified body in a makeshift shrine. Sorry I shared that part but it explains just how crazy this story is.

            That is actually scratching the surface of the crazy that is displayed in this documentary. There are just so many backwards beliefs I could list off, like the fact that “Mother God” believed she was not only the reincarnation of God but also people like Robin Williams, Harriet Tubman, Marilyn Monroe, and somehow also Donald Trump. Or the fact that she believed colloidal silver (a liquid containing tiny particles of silver) had healing powers, when in fact it turned her almost completely blue by the time of her death. This could all be attributed to the fact that she deemed alcohol and drugs as her medicine, a common theme in cults I guess. 

            What makes me confused the most is her followers and how they were able to make this cult money. "Mother God" would have Father God’s and one of them was letting her and all the followers live in his home. There they would just live and live stream a lot. Obviously, I don’t understand who was invested enough in "Mother God" to join the cult, but who are these people watching their live streams and buying their products? 

            At least for me, when I think cult or I’m about to watch a documentary about one, it is a thing of the past like the famous groups in the 70s, 80s, maybe even the 90s. It blows my mind that all of this took place in in recent years with the height of the story taking place in 2020-2021. "Mother God" was actually kicked out of Hawaii in 2020 when locals protested her and the groups arrival. She was not well received when she claimed to be the Hawaiian God Pele. 

            Besides this being probably the weirdest documentary I've seen maybe ever, it was a pretty good documentary. It was only 3 episodes, each about an hour long. It was easily entertaining, NEVER boring, and just good storytelling. It really covered everything. Would I recommend it? I dont know, it was kind of disturbing.
