        <div class="review_text">
            "When They See Us" isn't just a show; it's an emotional rollercoaster that grabs hold of your heartstrings and refuses to let go. I found myself plunged into a whirlwind of emotions from the very first episode, and by the time I reached the finale, I was a mess of tears and sniffles—yes, even in the middle of an airport.

            This gripping miniseries, created by Ava DuVernay, tells the harrowing true story of the Central Park Five—five Black and Latino teenagers wrongfully convicted of a brutal assault in New York City in the late 1980s. The injustice of their ordeal is laid bare for all to see, as we witness the devastating impact of systemic racism and corruption on their lives and the lives of their families.

            The performances in "When They See Us" are nothing short of extraordinary. Each actor brings depth and humanity to their role, capturing the pain, fear, and resilience of the real-life individuals they portray. Watching their struggles unfold on screen is a gut-wrenching experience that leaves a lasting impression.

            When your done watching this you also must go watch the, When The See Us Now, where the real exonerated men are interviewed by Oprah. It is amaxing to hear them tell their stories, and share their thoughts on the amazing actors that played them.
