        <div class="review_title">When They See Us: This Show Made Me Cry In An Aiport</div>

        <div class="review_text">
            "When They See Us" had me crying in an airport. Theres nothing else to say about this documentary than its one of the better documentaries I have ever seen, and I watch a,lottttt of documentaries.
            
           This gripping miniseries, created by Ava DuVernay, tells the true story of the Central Park Five. Somehow I had never heard of this case and I'm sure for many have but for context -- five Black and Latino teenagers were wrongfully convicted of a brutal assault that took place in New York City in the late 1980s. The five 14, 15, and 16 year olds were arrested and placed in the justice system after being cohorced into false confessions for anywhere from 5 to 13 years. 

           This series really is a very raw depiction of systemic racism. This is one of the saddest things I've watched, but I think one of the most memorable storylines was the true story in addition to the actors portrayal of Corey Wise. Being 16 at the time of his arrest, he was the oldest. Somehow being one year older he was tried as an adult, and sent to Rikers Island. Just imagine that. These are hard stories to tell and it take an insanely skilled actor to do it justice. Jharrel Jerome, who played Wise, did that. It was defianetly a scene of his in either the second to or last episode that had me crying in the airport. 

            When your done watching, because you have to watch it, you also must go watch the, When The See Us Now. This is a special where the real exonerated men are interviewed by Oprah. It is amazing to hear them tell their stories, and share their thoughts on the amazing actors that played them. They now call themselves the Exonerated Five. They've all taken the most negative thing that has happened to them and turned it into a positive by becoming activists that work to make sure similar cases don't happen again.
