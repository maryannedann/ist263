        <p>
        Outside of school, I <strong>love</strong>to watch movies and TV shows, if I’m not doing homework or with my friends im usually watching something. I am also a quite active person, I like to go to the gym or play tennis, pickleball, or any sport almost. I read sometimes but only if I feel like it’s a really good book. I have 3 sisters in my family.
